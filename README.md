## How It Works ⚡
The plugin uses a **complex scanning algorithm**:  
- Analyzes all scripts in your game  
- Detects where events are fired (`FireServer`, `FireClient`, `Fire`)  
- Detects where events are listened to (`OnServerEvent`, `OnClientEvent`, `Event`)  
- Collects line references and previews so you can jump straight to the code
